# AutoPlan
This is an item allocation interface for creating customized exercise/food schedules based on self-developed shuffling algorithms.

Initial designs were implemented in C++ by creating a RandomPQueue class to represent a set of items to allocate. Randomization algorithms were determined through heavy simulation and mathematical modeling. RPQueue was tested for reallocation size (how long before a given item is repeated), rarity (tests for items that the user wants to appear less frequently), "randomness" from the specific engine used, and overall efficiency.

Current work is being done on the front-end iOS application framework in Swift. UI/UX is currently under optimal design.
